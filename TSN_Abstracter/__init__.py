"""
**TSN Abstracter (alias TSNA or "The Sirio Network Abstracter") is a Python Module designed to accomplish relatively common tasks.**  

It was created during Kosaka's v2.X Versions and as its "Dependencies.py" file kept being ported over to other Python projects, TSNA was created to avoid sloppily copy pasting reused code and simplify the process of writing code.  
You are entirely on your own for figuring out what TSNA does and what functions would be useful in your use case. TSNA was purposefully built to build programs for TSN, as such no feature requests will be accepted, unless they're contributing to the function of a TSN Service.  

#### NOTICE: TSNA is only expected to be imported using `from TSN_Abstracter import *;`
It in theory could work to just import exactly what you need, but this hasn't been tested extensively.
